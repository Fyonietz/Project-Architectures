> *"We do not build. We rise."*

A metaphorical and functional C++ CLI tool to orchestrate your CMake build process like weaving the feathers of a Phoenix, watching it ignite, and soar into life.

---

## 🧩 What is Phoenix CLI?

**Phoenix** is a symbolic C++ utility tool that wraps common build steps using CMake and Ninja into expressive commands. Each phase of the tool mimics the rebirth of the Phoenix—starting from ashes, weaving feathers, and ending in a soaring executable.

This tool is particularly useful in **Windows environments** where `Phoenix.exe` is your target executable built from CMake sources.

## 🚀 Features

* 🔧 Build automation using **CMake + Ninja**
* 🔥 Metaphorical command structure (ashes, ignite, talon, etc.)
* 🌟 Friendly CLI output with poetic feedback
* 🪶 Symbolic lifecycle steps to mirror your build flow

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

* Windows OS
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) installed
* [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) build system installed
* Your build target should produce `Phoenix.exe`

## 📦 Build Instructions

Compile the tool (Phoenix CLI):

```bash
g++ phoenix_cli.cpp -o phoenix-cli
```

---

## 🧪 Usage

Run the CLI with one of the following commands:

```bash
pnix <command>
```

### 🔥 Available Commands

| Command   | Description                                              |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ashes`   | Prints a message signaling the dawn of a new build cycle |
| `ignite`  | Runs the `Phoenix.exe` executable directly               |
| `talon`   | Full CMake build process: configure, build, then execute |
| `resurge` | Placeholder for rebuild or re-run functionality          |
| `aether`  | Placeholder for deployment or distribution phase         |

### 🧵 Example Output (Talon Command)

```txt
 > Weaving Feather...
 > Fanning The Embers...
 > Binding Wings...
 > Phoenix Is Born...
```

## 📁 Directory Expectations

Make sure the Phoenix CLI is placed in the same directory as your `CMakeLists.txt`, and your build output will go to a `/build` directory.

---

## 💭 Future Ideas

* Linux/macOS support
* More poetic phases (`nest`, `flare`, `emberwatch`)
* Custom script runners or hooks
* Integration with logging or visualization

---

## 🐣 Final Words

The Phoenix CLI isn't just about building. It's about transforming a collection of files into something **alive**—reborn with every build.

> *“Each command is a feather. Each build, a resurrection.”*
